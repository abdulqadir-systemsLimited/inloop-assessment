1. How to Run and Test the Application?
   
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/abdulqadir-systemsLimited/Inloop-assessment.git

cd inloop_test

Install dependencies using 
   npm install 
   or
   yarn install

for running iOS:
 cd ios && pod install

run application: 

for iOS: npx react-native run-ios

for android: npx react-native run-android


Prerequisite: 
Xcode, Android Studio, Watchman, Cocoapods, node

2. The approach taken in developing this React Native application was based on the following: 

- The application was built with utilizing component-based architecture to ensure reusability and maintainability of code.

- Use latest functional based components

- Used React Hooks for handling side-effects

- Used simple design keeping time restriction in mind

3. Assumptions I made were that features are also important and keeping file structure as quick as possible yet separately maintained

4. Total time taken: 3-4 hours approximately 

5. Had some issue with watchman server need to kill that server, also searched for prettier command to fix linting issues, explore some svg icons but then dropped the idea saving time
